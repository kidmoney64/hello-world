my name is Daquan Collier
this project is about my wife and mother dream to build there own doula company.
so i have decided to help them by creating a webpage for them so they can get an head start in there career. so the web page contains what there goals are and what services they provied.
you click the tabs to go to the diffrent section in the page.
languges used:
Html
Css
idea for future inprovements
1.make a logo in the nav bar and make it return back to home when you click on it
2.i would add more color scheme to the webpage it seems bland right now
3.make ht webpage bigger and also create a tab for the bottom half of the page so they dont have to scroll all the way back to the top.
